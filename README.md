# oobshow
The website of the Out of Band Show

Plugins and Structure of default website

There are four main commands (npm run-script) that you can use.

FRONT END 
npm run dev //converts the files from the src/ folder and compiles them into a webpack development build in the dev/ folder 
npm run build //converts the files from the src/ folder and compiles them into a webpack production build in the dist/ folder

BACK END 
npm run server //runs the expressjs fileserver in the development environment (port 3000) 
npm run server-prod //runs the expressjs fileserver in the production environment (port 2000)

If you have any questions about how this works, I dunno, email me I guess?
